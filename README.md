✅ Ethics Evaluation:

Supports multiple research types:

- Clinical/Human Subjects

- Animal Research

- Food Production & Safety

- Academic Research & Publications

✅ Includes ethical considerations like informed consent, animal welfare (3Rs principle), privacy, environmental impact, and conflict of interest.

✅ Automated Evaluation
Assigns compliance scores and flags violations, warnings, and passes based on user input.

✅ Visual Feedback
Generates pie charts showing your biosafety and ethics compliance breakdown.

✅ Final Verdict
Informs whether the project meets the minimum compliance threshold (80%) and provides improvement tips.
